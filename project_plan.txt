Got it! Let me break down the project plan and provide some guidance on how to upgrade your EnDeCrypt web app using a full-stack technology stack.

1-Month Project Plan for EnDeCrypt

Week 1: Setting Up & Learning Full Stack Tech (React, Node.js, Express.js) and Authentication Basics

Learn React, Node.js, and Express.js Basics

Spend a couple of days going through tutorials and creating small projects to understand the basics.

Platforms like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, or YouTube tutorials can be quite helpful.

Set Up Your Development Environment

Install Node.js and set up your environment with React (create-react-app) and Express.js.

Set up the backend and frontend in separate directories within a main project folder.

Create Initial Project Structure

Define the basic structure:

Frontend: React app for UI.

Backend: Node.js/Express API for encryption and decryption operations.

Database: Use MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas) for storing user information.

Week 2: Implementing Encryption Features

Refactor the Existing Encryption Logic

Integrate existing Caesar Cipher functionality into your backend.

Create a new API endpoint for Caesar Cipher encryption/decryption.

Add New Encryption Options (Backend)

Use libraries like crypto (for SHA-256 and MD5), bcrypt, and base64 for base64 encoding/decoding.

Create different endpoints for each type of encryption/decryption:

/api/encrypt/caesar

/api/encrypt/sha256

/api/encrypt/base64 (encode & decode)

/api/encrypt/md5

/api/encrypt/hex etc.

Frontend Integration (React)

Create dropdown or selection buttons in your UI where the user can select the desired encryption method.

Set up forms and buttons for encrypting or decrypting based on the user's input and selected method.

Week 3: Login System & UI Improvements

Implement Login/Register Pages

Use Firebase Authentication or Passport.js to create a login/register system.

Backend: Set up authentication endpoints (/api/register, /api/login, /api/logout).

Frontend: Create forms for login and registration.

Implement user sessions with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access.

UI Improvements

Use React Bootstrap or Material-UI to enhance your web pages.

Add a navigation bar for switching between pages (e.g., Home, Encryption, Profile).

Week 4: Testing, Finalizing, and Deployment

Testing & Bug Fixing

Test all encryption/decryption options thoroughly.

Ensure the login system works without issues and secure sensitive information.

Debug any issues that arise with API requests or UI functionalities.

Deployment

Frontend Deployment: Use Vercel or Netlify to deploy your React frontend.

Backend Deployment: Deploy the Node.js backend using Heroku or Render.

Connect Frontend & Backend: Update API paths for the deployed versions so that the frontend correctly interacts with the backend.

Project Wrap-Up

Add a footer with social media links or contact information.

Consider adding a "history" feature to track previously encrypted/decrypted texts (optional).

backend/routes/encryptionRoutes.js: Define endpoints for various encryptions.

backend/controllers/encryptionController.js: Implement encryption logic using different algorithms.

frontend/src/components/: Contains reusable UI components (encryption form, login/register pages, navbar).

Guidance for a Smooth Start

React & Express Fundamentals

Understand how to make REST API calls from React using Axios or the Fetch API.

Understand props and state management in React, which will help in handling user input effectively.

Database and Authentication

MongoDB Atlas can be used to store user accounts.

Look into JWT Authentication for stateless user sessions.

Connecting Frontend & Backend

Understand CORS policies, and make sure to handle CORS issues when connecting your frontend to the backend.

Deployment Tips

Keep environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URIs) secret and secure using tools like dotenv.

Practice deploying small sample applications to get familiar with the process before deploying your main app.

Feel free to ask questions about any part of this process if you need more details or clarification on specific aspects!



REACT APP START----------------

Success! Created frontend at /home/guna/Desktop/Projects/Endecrypt/frontend
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd /home/guna/Desktop/Projects/Endecrypt/frontend
  npm start

Happy hacking!

----------------------
BACKEND STRUCTURE

#routes/encryptionRoutes.js:
-Here, you will define the routes for your encryption and decryption operations.

#controllers/encryptionController.js:
-Implement the logic for different encryption techniques here.

#models/User.js:
-Define your user schema for MongoDB using Mongoose.
